- You have 6 attempts to guess each player correctly
- Each revealed hint reduces your potential score by 10 points
- Maximum score per player is 100 points (if guessed without any hints)
- Your progress is automatically saved if you leave the game

## ðŸ”§ Appwrite Setup

1. Create an Appwrite project
2. Set up the following collections:
   - `users`: To store user profiles and scores
   - `players`: To store cricket player data and hints
3. Create a storage bucket for player images
4. Set up the appropriate attributes and indexes for each collection

### Players Collection Structure

Each player document should have:
- `playerName`: Name of the cricket player
- `hints`: Array of hint values [Country, Role, Debut Year, Total Matches, Franchise, Born, Retired?]
- `imageID`: ID of the player's image in the storage bucket
- `index`: Unique index number for the player

### Users Collection Structure

Each user document should have:
- `username`: User's display name
- `score`: User's total score
- `currentIndex`: Current player index the user is on
Deployment

This project is configured for deployment on Vercel. The `vercel.json` file includes the necessary configuration for proper routing with React Router.
